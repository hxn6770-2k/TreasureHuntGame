# Pirate Intelligent Agent - Deep Q-Learning Treasure Hunt

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a non-player character (NPC) in a treasure hunt game. The agent, a pirate, is tasked with navigating a complex game environment to find treasure before a human player can. 

The project began with starter code that outlined the basic structure of the game environment, including the grid, obstacles, and an initial setup for the Q-learning framework. My primary contribution was implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm that enables the pirate to find the optimal path to the treasure. Additionally, I enhanced the code by setting up the neural network, experience replay buffer, and training loop to ensure the pirate learns effectively from its environment.

## Connection to the Larger Field of Computer Science

Computer science is fundamentally about solving complex problems through the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms. In this project, I applied essential concepts such as reinforcement learning and neural networks to create an intelligent agent capable of making decisions in a dynamic environment.

The work done in this project reflects the broader activities of computer scientists, who develop algorithms that can adapt and optimize solutions for various applications, including game development and real-world robotics. These innovations in computer science contribute significantly to advancements in artificial intelligence, automation, and data analysis, impacting industries and society as a whole.

## Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking down complex tasks into manageable components, applying logical reasoning, and leveraging computational tools to devise solutions. 

For this project, I started by understanding the problem domain—pathfinding in a game environment—and proceeded to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm. Through a structured approach of testing, debugging, and optimizing the code, I ensured that the pirate agent performed effectively. This methodical approach is vital in computer science, where complex problems are tackled through careful planning and incremental development.

## Ethical Responsibilities

As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities encompass ensuring that the software developed is reliable, secure, and accessible to users. For this project, it was crucial to guarantee that the pirate agent operated fairly and predictably, without introducing unintended biases or errors that could negatively affect the user experience.

For the organization, it is essential to align the development process with the company's values and mission while adhering to legal and regulatory standards. Ensuring the code is maintainable, scalable, and respects intellectual property rights are also critical ethical considerations. My work must prioritize user well-being and maintain the integrity of the organization I represent.
